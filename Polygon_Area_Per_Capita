Data:

Census Blocks
Boundary
Hydrogragphy (Cut features)
Roads (Polygon or Line, Sewer (Line), Manhole

1) Ensure Data frame units are Feet (Project any non-feet units)

Project Census blocks and start new data frame with those units.

2)ERASE  Hydrography from Census Blocks

3) Calculate Area of Census Blocks in Acres

4) Fishnet (Set Area, Possibly pick by sample size)
-Polygon
-Set Area
-Extent is boundary Area

5)  Select Fishnet by Location and Export those that overlay
Boundary Area.

6) Calculated Cut Blocks in Acres

7) Allocate Pop into area of Cut Blocks

8) Sum Pop into Fishnet Squares w/ Spatial Join

-Convert into Points (Feature to Point)

-Ensure Join does not pick up bordering polygons.

-Delete Unnecessary Fields

**********************************************

Roads

239,363,524

1)  Calculate Full Area (Save for QA at End)

2)  Cut to Fishnet and Recalculate Area

Sum and Check Area

3) Convert to Point within Poly for Spatial Join

-Remove Area = 0 polygons first.



4) Spatial Join with Fishnet and Sum Area

-Delete Additional Fields

5)Check Total Area


**********************************************


Manhole Covers

1) Merge Multiple Files (Remove all Fields)

-If merge fails then spatial join files separately
and add together.

2) Sum into Fishnet Census Grid

**********************************************


Sewer Mains

1) Merge SW ans SS main files

2) Calculate Linear Ft (Save total)

3) Convert to Point (Sum)

4) Spatial Join Points to Fisnet Grid

5) Check total with pre-join.
-Delete unncecessary fields.
