#Grid Cell ArcMap tools


This is a very rough copy of the script that I use to divide population (from Census Blocks) and infrastructure into grid cells of a specified area.

I might come back and rework some of these files to make them more suitable to share, but for now they are good enough to save time in my own projects. Included with the Python Scripts, and the custom ArcMap toolbox are some shapefiles and an mxd to go with them in ArcMap. They should help test things out for whomever might be interested in adapting these for their own project.
